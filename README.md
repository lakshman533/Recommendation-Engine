# Recommendations with IBM Project

For this project we analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like.

# Introduction

The goal of the project is to do recommendation of the articles that are most relavent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform is performed. Here are the main steps:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis 

II. Rank Based Recommendations 

III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering 

IV. Content Based Recommendations 

V. Matrix Factorization

# Libraries

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib

Pickle
